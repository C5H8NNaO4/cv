Created a cherished ES5 JavaScript compiler, a pivotal first project that facilitated profound learning in static software analysis, encompassing jQuery and Angular.js compilation with a visual rendering of jQuery's Control Flow Graph. Enabled ES5 AST transformation into CFGs and performed dataflow analysis, further branching into the derivation of variable values at any program point. Explored size optimizations, ventured into SSA and loop unrolling in experimental stages, culminating in an enriching learning curve, fostering a desire for future compiler projects while adapting to emerging technologies like Babel, showcasing project relevance and parallelities.
