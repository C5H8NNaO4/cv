Developed an ES5 JavaScript compiler as a first project, enabling sophisticated static software analysis including partial abstract interpretation for a subset of ES5. Compiles jQuery and Angular.js, visualizing jQuery's Control Flow Graph (CFG) and performing dataflow analysis. Transformed ES5 ASTs into CFGs, exploring variable value derivation, size optimizations, SSA, and loop unrolling. Minifies and pretty prints.
