An optimizing ES5 compiler, written in JavaScript. Definitely my all-time favorite project. Just the right complexity for my first project.
I learnt a lot about static software analysis along the way. It compiles jQuery and Angular.js and is able to render a visual representation of the CFG of jQuery.
It can transform full ES5 AST's into CFG's and perform dataflow analysis on the computed CFG. A fork of the project is also able to compute concrete interpretations of any point P in the program. This can be used to statically derive the value of any variable at any point in the program. e.g. the value of a variable in the middle or at the end of a loop.
The only optimizations that I implemented were size optimizations. e.g. uglifying or pretty-printing the code. SSA and loop unrolling have been implemented experimentally but not finished. Overall this was a good learning experience and I would love to work on another compiler some day. On a side note: I wrote this before Babel existed and was in the middle of adding an ES6 parser that compiles back to ES5. I dropped the project when Babel came out. It works pretty similar. Even the computed AST looks very similar.
