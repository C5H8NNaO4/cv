I'm a {{age}}-year-old software developer from Germany.
My favorite language is without a doubt <del>JavaScript</del><mark>TypeScript</mark>. It's the language I grew up with, learning to code and still love to use on a daily basis {{consts.TRAINING_START}} later.
I'm really happy to see the language evolve, driven by the community, and see tools like Babel grow from an experiment to the leading standard for transpiling JavaScript.
I have about <mark>{{experience.JavaScript}} years</mark> of in-depth knowledge in <mark>JavaScript</mark> and can handle complex tasks like writing a compiler.
I spent about {{experience.Node-js}} years on Node.js and have experience with a variety of frameworks like {{tags.frameworks}}, etc...
<mark>React</mark> is definitely my favorite framework of the last years and has been what kept me fascinated over the past years.
I have experience working with experienced remote teams of senior developers in an agile environment using Scrum.
I value <mark>code quality</mark> over quantity and am experienced in working with and maintaining a high-quality codebase.
As a team we leverage unit tests, end-to-end tests and visual regression tests to assure quality and reduce the workload of QA. As with most experienced scrum teams, staged environments, <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipelines, and thorough code review are a standar.
I love to code, and I highly appreciate quality code. I prefer TypeScript over JS because type safety is a valuable tool to vastly reduce the chance of introducing bugs.
I’m used to restrictive <mark>ESLint</mark> rulesets and formatters.
I'm well familiar with Git and Docker and use both on a daily basis. I'm used to conventional branching models.
I have experience writing serverless applications on AWS (Lambda) and DynamoDB.
I love writing code. From code-golfing and king-of-the-hill battles over crypto trading bots to processing high-frequency real-time sensor data or doing sophisticated statical software analysis.
I like to experiment a lot, so most of my projects don't make it past a proof of concept stage as the last 20% are usually the most time-consuming.
I spent the last two years working with analyzing and processing high quantities of real-time data (about 1.5M data points/day) and the problems that arise trying to analyze that amount of disjoint data.
I’m currently developing a server-side framework that brings React to the server side and allows you to develop modular, prodution-grade backend components.
