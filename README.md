# A Data Driven CV for Web Developers

A data driven CV for web developers that keeps track of your experience. Just configure some starting data and you are good to go. The project uses _i18n_ to interpolate markdown files. You can add your own Biography to the _/src/data/bio/\*.md_ files.

Simply render your CV to pdf or use pre-rendered files for mobile. e.g. https://justmycv.com/en.pdf

You will need to replace _skills, projects, work experience, and education data_ with your own data.

Experience with TypeScript, React and MUI is recommended.

A boilerplate template to quickly host an interactive CV on Vercel.
